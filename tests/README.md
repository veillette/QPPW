**Stringent Requirements:**

- Parity detection tolerance: 2% (was 5%)
- Derivative continuity tolerance: 1.5% (was 3%)
- Orthogonality tolerance: 1% (new)
- Grid points: 1500 (was 1000)

**Run the double well test suite:**

```bash
npm run test:double-well
```

## Running Tests

### Method 1: Browser-Based Tests

This provides a visual interface for running tests.

1. **Start the development server** from the root directory:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open the test runner** in a web browser:

   ```bash
   # The dev server typically runs on http://localhost:5173
   # Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/tests/accuracy-tests.html
   # Or open tests/accuracy-tests.html directly in your browser
   # On macOS:
   open tests/accuracy-tests.html
   # On Linux:
   xdg-open tests/accuracy-tests.html
   # On Windows:
   start tests/accuracy-tests.html
   ```

3. **Run tests** by clicking one of the buttons:
   - **"Run Full Tests"** - Runs comprehensive test suite (tests all methods across all potentials and grid sizes)
   - **"Run Quick Check"** - Runs a subset for rapid validation

### Method 2: Command-Line Tests (Recommended)

Run tests directly from the command line using npm test.

```bash
# From the root directory
npm test
```

This will execute the comprehensive test suite and display results in the terminal, including:

- Pass/fail status for each test
- Numerical vs analytical energy comparisons
- Error percentages
- **Execution times for each method**
- **Performance summary with timing statistics**

### Method 3: Development Server + Browser Console

Useful during active development.

1. **Start the development server** from the root directory:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to the local server URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

3. **Open browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) and run:

   ```javascript
   // Run full comprehensive test suite
   import("./common/model/AccuracyTests.js").then((m) => m.runAccuracyTests());

   // Or run quick check only
   import("./common/model/AccuracyTests.js").then((m) =>
     m.runQuickAccuracyCheck(),
   );
   ```

### Method 4: Direct TypeScript Execution (Advanced)

You can also run the terminal test runner directly using tsx:

```bash
# Run with tsx (this is what npm test does)
npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.test.json tests/run-terminal-tests.js

# Or run the TypeScript source directly (requires mock setup)
npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.test.json src/common/model/AccuracyTests.ts
```

**Note**: The project uses tsx (TypeScript executor) rather than building to JavaScript files.

## Test Functions

The AccuracyTests module exports two main functions:

- **`runAccuracyTests()`** - Runs the full comprehensive test suite
- **`runQuickAccuracyCheck()`** - Runs a quick subset of tests for rapid validation

## Understanding Test Results

### Individual Test Output

Each test reports:

- **Status**: ✓ PASSED or ✗ FAILED
- **Maximum error**: The largest percentage error found across all energy levels
- **Execution time**: Time taken to solve in milliseconds
- **Individual energy levels**: Detailed comparison showing:
  - Numerical result (in eV)
  - Analytical/reference result (in eV)
  - Percentage error

Example output:

```
=== DVR - Harmonic Oscillator (N=150) ===
Status: ✓ PASSED
Maximum error: 0.0234%

Testing 5 energy levels with 150 grid points:
Execution time: 12.45 ms
  E_0: ✓ Num: 0.413567 eV, Ana: 0.413470 eV, Err: 0.0234%
  E_1: ✓ Num: 1.240567 eV, Ana: 1.240410 eV, Err: 0.0127%
  ...
```

### Performance Summary

At the end of the test run, a performance summary shows timing statistics for each method:

```
--- Performance Summary ---
DVR:
  Average: 15.34 ms | Min: 8.21 ms | Max: 45.67 ms | Total: 245.44 ms
MatrixNumerov:
  Average: 12.89 ms | Min: 7.45 ms | Max: 38.23 ms | Total: 206.24 ms
Spectral:
  Average: 18.76 ms | Min: 10.34 ms | Max: 52.11 ms | Total: 300.16 ms
FGH:
  Average: 22.14 ms | Min: 11.56 ms | Max: 68.92 ms | Total: 354.24 ms
```

This allows you to:

- Compare performance across different methods
- Identify which method is fastest for your use case
- Track performance regressions over time

### Error Tolerances

All tests now use stringent tolerances with maximum 1% error:

- **Harmonic Oscillator**: **0.1%** - Very well-behaved smooth potential, extremely high accuracy expected
- **Finite Square Wells**: **0.5%** - Despite discontinuous potential, accurate methods achieve sub-1% error
- **3D Coulomb**: **1.0%** - Singular potential at r=0, still achieves 1% accuracy with proper grid
- **Morse Potential**: **1.0%** - Anharmonic potential with exact analytical solutions
- **Pöschl-Teller**: **1.0%** - Hyperbolic potential with exact analytical solutions
- **Double Square Wells**: **1.0%** - Inter-method comparison (vs DVR reference, no analytical solution)

## Adding New Tests

To add new test cases:

1. Open `src/common/model/AccuracyTests.ts`
2. Create a new test function following the pattern of existing tests
3. Add your test to the `runAccuracyTests()` function
4. Rebuild the project: `npm run build`

See `docs/ACCURACY_TESTS.md` for more details on test design.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Cannot find module 'AccuracyTests.js'

If you see an error like:

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/home/.../src/common/model/AccuracyTests.js'
```

This occurs when trying to run `node tests/run-terminal-tests.js` directly. The project uses **TypeScript with tsx**, not compiled JavaScript files.

**Solution**: Use `npm test` instead, which correctly runs the TypeScript files with tsx.

### Specialized Tests

In addition to the main test suite (`npm test`), you can run specialized tests:

```bash
# Run comprehensive double well test suite (23 stringent tests)
npm run test:double-well

# Run Coulomb potential verification tests
npm run test:coulomb

# Run multi-square well tests (NEW)
npm run test:multi-square-well

# Run multi-Coulomb 1D tests (NEW)
npm run test:multi-coulomb-1d
```

**New Test Suites:**

- **Multi-Square Well Tests**: Validates the multi-well potential solver for 1-10 wells
  - Tests energy band formation
  - Verifies quantum tunneling between wells
  - Checks wavefunction localization
  - Validates against analytical solutions

- **Multi-Coulomb 1D Tests**: Validates the multi-Coulomb center solver for 1-10 centers
  - Tests molecular orbital formation
  - Verifies energy level ordering
  - Checks odd-parity enforcement for each center
  - Validates interference patterns

## Notes

- These tests ensure that numerical methods produce accurate results within acceptable error tolerances
- Tests validate correctness across different grid sizes to ensure robustness
- The comprehensive test suite now covers all major quantum potential types
- The project uses **tsx** to run TypeScript directly without a separate build step for tests
- All debug and redundant test files have been removed to simplify maintenance
