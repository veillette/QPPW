# Quantum Bound States Simulation

An interactive quantum mechanics simulation exploring the behavior of quantum particles in potential wells. This educational tool visualizes wave functions, probability densities, and energy levels for bound states in various quantum potentials.

## Overview

This simulation allows users to explore the properties of quantum "particles" bound in potential wells and observe how the wave functions and probability densities that describe them evolve (or don't evolve) over time. Users can interactively manipulate potential wells and see real-time solutions to the 1D Schrödinger equation.

npm run build

# 2. Open the test runner in your browser
# On macOS:
open tests/accuracy-tests.html
# On Linux:
xdg-open tests/accuracy-tests.html
