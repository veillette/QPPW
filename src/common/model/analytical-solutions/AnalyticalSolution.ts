 * Abstract base class for analytical solutions to quantum mechanical potentials.

 * - Solving the Schrödinger equation to get energies and wavefunctions
 * - Creating the potential function
 * - Calculating classical probability density
 * - Finding wavefunction zeros (nodes)
 * - Determining classical turning points
 * - Computing wavefunction second derivatives
